                    <p class="text-danger">VAR :</p>

                            <span>Function Scope : </span>
                            Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are only
                            accessible within the function where they are defined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Hoisting : </span>
                            Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
                            containing function or global scope, meaning you can use them
                            before they are declared, but they will be initialized with
                            undefined until their actual declaration.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-success">LET :</p>
                    <ul class="text-success">
                        <li>
                            <span>Block Scope : </span>
                            Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are
                            accessible only within the block where they are defined. A block
                            can be a function, loop, or any code enclosed in curly braces {}.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span> Hoisting : </span>
                            Variables declared with let are also hoisted to the top of their
                            containing block, but they are not initialized, so you can't use
                            them before their declaration.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-primary">CONST :</p>

                    <ul class="text-primary">
                        <li>
                            <span> Block Scope : </span>
                            Like let, const is also block-scoped.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span> Immutability : </span>
                            Variables declared with const are meant to be constants, and their
                            value cannot be reassigned after initialization. However, for
                            objects and arrays declared with const, you can still modify their
                            properties or elements; you just can't reassign the variable
                            itself.

                    <li>
                        <span>Explicit Absence of Value :</span>
                        null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any
                        object value or value in general. It is typically used when you
                        want to indicate that a variable or property should have no value
                        or that it has been intentionally cleared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>As a Placeholder :</span>
                        It can also be used as a placeholder or initial value that might
                        be assigned a value later in your code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Returned by Functions :</span>
                        Some functions or methods may return null to indicate that they
                        did not find a meaningful result.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-info">Undefined :</p>

                    <li>
                        <span>Default Value :</span>
                        In JavaScript, variables that have been declared but have not been
                        assigned a value are automatically initialized with undefined. So,
                        undefined is often used as the default value for function
                        parameters and variables.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Property Access :</span>
                        If you try to access an object property that does not exist, you
                        will get undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Array Elements :</span>
                        When you access an array element that is beyond the current length
                        of the array, you get undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Function Return :</span>
                        If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns
                        undefined.
                    </li>

                        application programming interface that adheres to the constraints of
                        REST architectural style and enables interaction with RESTful web
                        services. Interconnected networks make up the web. A web service is
                        a set of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data
                        between client-server applications. Web services that follow the
                        REST architecture are known as RESTful web services.
